Solution #1
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

def remove_char(s):
    return s[1 : -1]


Solution #2
Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

def no_space(x):
    return x.replace(" ", "")
    
    
Solution #3
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained (Read the notes for more detail about it)

def expression_matter(a, b, c):
    return max(a*b*c, a+b+c, a*(b+c), a + b*c, (a+b)*c)
    
    
Solution #4
Terminal game move function
In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice two times.
Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.

def move(position, roll):
    return position + 2*roll
    

Solution #5
The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second century - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

Task
Given a year, return the century it is in.

def century(year):
    return (year + 99) // 100
